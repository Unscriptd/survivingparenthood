Build a production-ready affiliate + content site called SurvivingParenthood.co.
The site helps parents survive parenthood through honest product reviews, survival hacks, and practical guides.
The brand voice is raw, witty, and relatable — telling the truth about the chaos of raising kids while giving parents tested gear, tips, and tricks to make it through.
